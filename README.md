# Terraform VPC Creation README

This README provides a guide for using Terraform to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on a cloud provider of your choice. A VPC is a fundamental building block in cloud infrastructure that allows you to logically isolate and segment your resources within a private network.

## Prerequisites

1. **Terraform Installation:** Ensure that you have Terraform installed on your machine. You can download and install Terraform from the official website: [Terraform Downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

2. **Cloud Provider Account:** You need an account on the cloud provider of your choice (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Ensure you have the necessary credentials and API keys set up.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to create a basic VPC using Terraform:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-vpc.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Change your current directory to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd terraform-vpc
   ```

3. **Configure Cloud Provider Credentials:** Create a file named `terraform.tfvars` in the project directory and configure your cloud provider credentials:

   ```hcl
   # terraform.tfvars

   aws_access_key = "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY"
   aws_secret_key = "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY` with your actual AWS access key and secret key.

4. **Initialize Terraform:** Run the following command to initialize the Terraform working directory:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

5. **Review and Modify Configuration:** Open the `main.tf` file and review the configuration for your VPC. Modify the settings, such as VPC name, IP ranges, and any additional settings, according to your requirements.

6. **Create the VPC:** Run the following command to create the VPC based on your configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   You will be prompted to confirm the creation. Type `yes` and press Enter.

7. **Cleanup:** When you're done experimenting, remember to destroy the resources to avoid incurring unnecessary charges:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

   Again, you will be prompted to confirm the destruction. Type `yes` and press Enter.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the `main.tf` file to add more resources like subnets, security groups, and instances to your VPC.
